# **StackSpace Rental Smart Contract**  

## **Overview**  
The **StackS Rental service Smart Contract** is a **Clarity-based** contract designed to facilitate the **rental of cloud-based storage** for users and organizations. It enables **renting, releasing, and extending storage space**, as well as **managing organizational settings, user roles, and audit logs**.

## **Features**  
- **Rent storage space** with a specified duration and auto-renewal options.  
- **Release storage space** before expiration.  
- **Extend rental duration** (future functionality).  
- **Organization management**, including settings, CRM, and additional services.  
- **Role-based access control** via user role assignment.  
- **Audit logging** (future functionality for tracking actions).  

## **Contract Structure**  

### **1. Storage Rental**  
- **rent-space**: Allows users to rent storage space for a specific duration.  
- **get-rental-details**: Fetches the details of a user's rental.  
- **release-space**: Releases the rented space before the expiration date.  
- **is-rental-active**: Checks if a user's rental is still active.  

### **2. Organization Management**  
- **create-org**: Creates an organization with metadata such as settings, payment info, and CRM configuration.  
- **update-org-settings** *(commented out for now)*: Allows updating organization settings (to be implemented).  

### **3. Role Management**  
- **assign-role**: Assigns a specific role to a user.  
- **get-user-role**: Retrieves the role of a given user.  

### **4. Audit Logging** *(Future Feature)*  
- **get-audit-log**: Retrieves the log of a specific action.  
- **log-action** *(commented out for now)*: Stores an action performed on the contract for auditing purposes.  

## **Installation & Deployment**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Clarity smart contract development environment.  
- Stacks CLI for testing and deployment.  

### **Deployment Steps**  
1. Write the contract file in **Clarity**.  
2. Deploy the contract on **Stacks Blockchain** using Stacks CLI:  
   ```sh
   clarinet deploy
   ```
3. Interact with the contract via the **Stacks Explorer** or CLI.  

## **Usage Example**  

### **Rent Storage Space**  
```clarity
(contract-call? .stackspace-rental rent-space tx-sender u100 u30 false none)
```
This rents **100 units of space** for **30 blocks** without auto-renewal.  

### **Check Rental Status**  
```clarity
(contract-call? .stackspace-rental get-rental-details tx-sender)
```
Retrieves rental details for the caller.  

### **Assign a User Role**  
```clarity
(contract-call? .stackspace-rental assign-role tx-sender "Admin")
```
Assigns the **Admin** role to the caller.
